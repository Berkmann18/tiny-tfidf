# tiny-tfidf
Minimal implementations of a couple of classic text analysis tools (TF-IDF and cosine similarity). The goal is to create something simple that can be used to explain the techniques, rather than for use in production. 

This is an ES6 module and is intended for use with small sets of documents in the browser, rather than with Node.js ([more background](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/blob/master/doc/announcement.md#es-module-code-in-packages))
